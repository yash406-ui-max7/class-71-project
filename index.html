            <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">Parenting styles, education systems, tuitions, extra-curricular activities and the like have always been hot topics of discussion among parents. Every parent believes their style is the best, and since the Gurgaon parent is extremely proactive on online forums on every debate, from which school’s better to how much sleep your child should get, living-room discussions and online threads these days are all about whether AC classrooms are the way to go or not. There are those who believe that airconditioned schools make children spoilt, arrogant and soft. But the counter-argument by others is that when ACs are a vital part of homes, and power cuts give people nightmares, why should children be subjected to the harsh weather? Two Gurgaon parents debate this.Kanupriya Jain, 37, a textile and graphic designer who lives in Park View City1, Sohna road, is sure that she doesn’t want an AC school for her two-year-old. She lists out her reasons: I have studied in a non-airconditioned school and I feel that people of our time are more rough and tough. Even though we are in airconditioning most of the time nowadays, we don’t shy away from standing under the sun when needed. But children today can’t stand the heat. It is majorly because of their habit of being under AC all the time. Also, I have observed that immunity levels are higher in people who spend less time in AC environments.</p>

            <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">In today's competitive world, with increasing working hours and less classroom time, teachers need edTech tools which help them manage precious class time efficiently. Instead of focusing on teaching, faculty members are often stuck with completing formal duties, for e.g. taking daily student attendance. Manually taking attendance and registering it in files & musters makes the daily attendance a mundane task for the faculty and unnecessarily consumes classroom time. To overcome such inefficient work processes, there are various school software systems available to speed up the attendance process and reduce manual work. An online attendance management system or digital attendance platform is one of them, which is developed to automate the daily attendance in schools. Additionally, it helps to maintain accurate records and generate summarized student attendance reports.Each student is given a smart RFID card having a unique identification number. The RFID can be installed at the entrance of the school, classroom, library or any other important location. Students carrying their smart cards simply have to pass through the reader and the reader scans their unique identification number and hence the attendance is marked automatically. Since the RFID reader is capable of reading several cards at once, the attendance of multiple students is marked simultaneously. The data from the RFID reader is automatically fetched by the integrated school ERP software. Hence, the schools get the access to student attendance details of every class and section at once. Mark, Track & Manage School Attendance Online.</p>
